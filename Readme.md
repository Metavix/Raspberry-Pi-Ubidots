# Raspberry Pi - WiFi/Ethernet


Raspberry Pi has become a widely used device, not only for prototyping and educational purposes, but also for production projects within companies.

Best described as a pocket-size $25 computer, it features all the components and peripherals needed to perform most tasks your desktop PC would do, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games.

Besides its small size, low cost and fully operational Linux OS, the greatest difference from your Destkop PC lies in its ability to interact with other peripherals through GPIO pins (General Purpose Input/Ourput Pins).

This allows you to code pretty robust hardware applications without having to be an expert in embedded electronics.

At the end of this guide youâ€™ll be able to send data values from your Pi to Ubidots.

## Requirements

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

* Raspberry Pi Model B (512MB)
* A Raspberry Pi compatible WiFi dongle (Edimax EW-7811Un in this case)
* 4 GB SD Card
* Micro USB power adaptor 

## Setup

>SETUP STEPS

>Step One

```bash
user: pi 
password: raspberry
```

>Step Two

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

>Step Three

```bash
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
wpa-ssid "YOUR WIFI NETWORK NAME"
wpa-psk "YOUR WIFI PASSWORD"
```

>Step Four

```bash
$ sudo reboot
```

>Step Five

```bash
$ sudo ifconfig wlan0
```

>Step six

```bash
      $ sudo apt-get update
      $ sudo apt-get upgrade
```

>Step Seven

```bash
    $ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
    $ sudo easy_install pip
    $ sudo pip install ubidots
```

1. If you have already done a basic setup of your Raspberry Pi you can jump this  step, otherwise continue with this
  * Download the Raspberry Pi operating system, we recommend [Raspbian Wheezy](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads).
  * Unzip the file and you'll end up with a large IMG file: DON'T COPY AND PASTE THIS FILE INTO YOUR SD CARD, because it won't work. You'll need to write it properly to the SD card by following these steps according to your operating system: 
      - [MacOS](http://ivanx.com/raspberrypi/)
      - [Linux](http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Using_Linux_.28including_on_a_Pi.21.29)
      - [Windows](http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Using_Windows_7_or_Windows_XP)
  * Plug a keyboard and a monitor through the HDMI or TV/Analog ports.
  * **seealso**: [Quick Start Guide](http://www.raspberrypi.org/quick-start-guide) from the Raspberry Pi official site.


2. Connecting your Raspberry Pi through WiFi. Your Raspberry Pi already has an Ethernet port, however, it can be turned into a wireless device by adding a USB WIFI dongle.

    **Figure 1:** Raspberry pi with USB WIFI dongle from EDIMAX
      First, we'll need to make sure your device is connected to the web through your local WIFI network

3. Plug the USB WiFi Dongle, then restart your RasPi.
4. Login to the device using your credentials, typically as Step One
5. Open file of step two from the console
6. Modify the file so that it looks like step three
7. Reboot your device with step four code
8. Follow step five code to verify the WiFi connection. You must be able to see an IP address assigned to the 'wlan0' interface.
9. Configure your Raspberry Pi to use our Python API Client.  
    * In step six, Let's make sure your device is up to date so that it has the latest python tools (be aware that this will take a while)
    * Use step seven code to download the pip installer and install Ubidots' Python library 
10. Setup a test Variable in Ubidots  
    * As a [logged in user](http://app.ubidots.com/accounts/signin/) navigate to the "Data" tab.
    * Create a Data Source by clicking on the orange icon on the right. Then create a variable within that Data Source.
    * Take note of the variable's ID to which you want to send data. For this example we'll use a variable with the ID:
   "521d792df91b2816f35c8587"
    * Take note of your [API key](http://app.ubidots.com/userdata/api/).

## Send one value to Ubidots

1. Create a directory called "ubidots" where you can put this and future scripts
2. Create a python script using your favorite text-editor. We'll use "nano" in this case
3. Put the following code into the created file. Please note the fields where you should put your API key and your variable ID.
4. Run the code several times to send some random values to the cloud
    You should now see some data-points in your browser!

Once your data is in the cloud, it's all down the hill. You can trigger events according to your data, create insights to share, etc.

>Step One

```bash
$ mkdir ubidots
```

>Step Two

```bash
$ cd ubidots
$ nano ubi-test-save.py
```
   
>Step Three

```python
from ubidots import ApiClient
import random

#Create an "API" object

api = ApiClient("7fj39fk3044045k89fbh34rsd9823jkfs8323")

#Create a "Variable" object

test_variable = api.get_variable("521d792df91b2816f35c8587")

#Here is where you usually put the code to capture the data, either through your GPIO pins or as a calculation. We'll simply put a random value here:

test_value = random.randint(1,100)

#Write the value to your variable in Ubidots

test_variable.save_value({'value':test_value})
```

>Step Four

```bash
$ python ubi-test-save.py
```
  

## Get one value from Ubidots

>Step One

```bash
$ cd ubidots
$ nano ubi-test-get.py
```

>Step Two

```python
from ubidots import ApiClient
import random

#Create an "API" object

api = ApiClient("7fj39fk3044045k89fbh34rsd9823jkfs8323")

#Create a "Variable" object

variable = api.get_variable("521d792df91b2816f35c8587")

#Get the value from Ubidots
last_value = variable.get_values(1)
```

>Step Three

```bash
$ python ubi-test-get.py
```

1. Create a python script using your favorite text-editor. We'll use "nano" in this case. See the step one
2. Put the step two code into the created file. Please note the fields where you should put your API key and your variable ID.    
3. Run the step three code several times to send some random values to the cloud 

## Send multiple values to Ubidots

>Step One

```bash
$ cd ubidots
$ nano ubi-test-save-values.py
```

>Step Two

```py
from ubidots import ApiClient
import random

#Create an "API" object

api = ApiClient("7fj39fk3044045k89fbh34rsd9823jkfs8323")

api.save_collection([
  {'variable': '557f686f7625426a41a42f49', 'value': 10}, 
  {'variable': '557f68747625426b97263cba', 'value': 20},
  {'variable': '557f68747625426fdd246872', 'value': 20}
])
```

>Step Three

```bash
$ python ubi-test-save-values.py
```

1. Create a python script using your favorite text-editor. We'll use "nano" in this case. See the step one
2. Put the step two code into the created file. Please note the fields where you should put your API key and your variable ID.    
3. Run the step three code several times to send some random values to the cloud
